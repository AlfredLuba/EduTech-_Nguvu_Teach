Our team combines local expertise with technical proficiency to deliver impactful solutions.My JourneyAs a refugee in Kalobeyei Settlement, I completed secondary school without knowing how to create a single folder on a computer. My first encounter with a computer was in June 2017 during a computer application course at Don Bosco Kakuma.
From that moment, I knew technology would change my life.
I dreamed of becoming a technology professional, and today, in November 2024, I am proud to be the founder of Nguvu-TEACH. Despite financial limitations and the responsibility of supporting my family of 10, I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at Victoria University.This journey is a testament to the power of resilience, hard work, and the belief that everyone deserves access to technology.
